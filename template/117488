Welcome to the W3C Decentralized Identifier Working Group!

We are delighted to have you join us. Our mission is is to standardize the DID URI scheme, the data model and syntax of DID Documents, which contain information related to DIDs that enable the aforementioned initial use cases, and the requirements for DID Method specifications.

Our co-chairs are Daniel Burnett (Invited Expert) and Brent Zundel (Evernym). The staff contact is Pierre-Antoine Champin.
