Welcome to the W3C {{ group.name }}, known as IDCG!

The IDCG is an informal place where everyone is welcome to share their ideas, to pitch in and work, to provide different perspectives, or simply to listen.

Everyone who is involved in IDCG is expected to behave in accordance with the W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (CEPC):
https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/

We are in the process of teaming up with the [W3C Positive Work Environment (PWE) CG](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/pwe) to continue all our activities as a single CG. Please don't forget to join the PWE CG if you're not already a member because that is where future meetings and logistics will be managed.

We're working on different actions, and you can explore them and contribute to discussions here:
https://github.com/w3c/idcg/issues/

We have two email lists that you've been added to automatically: public-idcg@w3.org and internal-idcg@w3.org. The first is where most of our discussions (other than those on Github) happen, the second is for discussions that we want to keep just between members of the CG.

If you have any questions, you are welcome to contact Léonie or Coralie at any time.

Léonie and Coralie, ID CG co-chairs.
