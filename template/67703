Hello,

Welcome to the the Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (Coga TF) of the Accessibility Guidelines (AG) Working Group (WG) and the Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group. This message is to introduce you to the work. It is copied to the facilitators and staff contacts. Please feel free to reach out with questions.

You should begin getting emails from the public-cognitive-a11y-tf@w3.org mailing list starting today. You may want to create a folder for each W3C list you are on as there can be a lot of email traffic. Assuming you want to start with COGA, I recommend you set email rules to mark all AG and APA emails as read and focus just on the COGA emails for the time being. AG and APA lists are more active and can be overwhelming as you get started.

The COGA taskforce meets on Thursdays at 10am Eastern time. The meeting information is at https://www.w3.org/2017/08/telecon-info_coga and includes a link to the meeting time in your own time zone. You should receive the agenda each Tuesday on the mailing list.

The web pages we recommend you review first for the task force are:

   - https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/#communication
   - https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/wiki/PlanningPage

When you are first able to attend a meeting, we will conduct a quick round of introductions. Please let us know if you need anything else to get started.

Best regards,

COGA leadership
